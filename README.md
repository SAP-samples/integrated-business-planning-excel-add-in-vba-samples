# VBA Samples for SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP), Add-in for Microsoft Excel

Collection of planning views enhanced with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) coding. These samples should kick-start the creation of customized planning view templates to be used for SAP IBP.

## Description

You can enhance planning views of the SAP IBP, add-in for Microsoft Excel by using VBA coding. This GitHub repository contains several samples to illustrate existing use cases and capabilities. The coding is not intended for productive usage and might need to be adapted based on the configuration of the selected SAP IBP system.

## Requirements

To test these samples, you need an SAP IBP tenant and a configured planning area with master data and key figure data. To be able to work with planning views, you need to install the SAP IBP, Add-in for Microsoft Excel. We recommend using one of the latest versions of the Excel add-in. Please make sure that you're allowed to use VBA enabled workbooks based on your corporate IT guideline. 

## Download and Installation

To test the VBA samples, simply download the desired Excel workbook, navigate to the SAP IBP tab and log on to the specific planning area of your SAP IBP system. Then adjust the planning view and the VBA coding according to your needs. The VBA coding can be viewed by using the Visual Basic Editor (in the tab “Developer”, please check Excel Options > Customize Ribbon, if this tab doesn’t show up). Please make yourself familiar with the coding and include only the parts which are needed.
All VBA samples can be found in the folder "VBA samples". For all business-related use cases, you'll find one dedicated folder. You'll find the getting started content right away in the folder "VBA samples". This example is intended to expose all existing VBA methods that are related to SAP IBP.
For more information about installing the SAP IBP, add-in for Microsoft Excel have a look at SAP note 2135948.
