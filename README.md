## Description

You can enhance SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP) Excel workbooks by using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) coding.

To be able to work with planning views, you need to install the SAP IBP, Add-in for Microsoft Excel. Please use one of the latest SAP IBP Excel Add-ins. Please make sure that you're allowed to use VBA enabled workbooks based on your corporate IT guideline.
