# VBA samples for SAP IBP, Add-in for Microsoft Excel

Collection of planning view enhanced with VBA coding. These samples should kick-start your VBA journey within SAP IBP.

## Description

You can enhance SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP) Excel workbooks by using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) coding. This GitHub repository contains several samples to illustrate existing use cases and capabilities. The coding is not intended for productive usage and might need to be adapated based on the configuration of the selected SAP IBP system.  

## Requirements

To be able to work with planning views, you need to install the SAP IBP, Add-in for Microsoft Excel. Please use one of the latest SAP IBP Excel Add-ins. Please make sure that you're allowed to use VBA enabled workbooks based on your corporate IT guideline. 

## Download and Installation

To test the VBA samples, simply download the desired Excel workbook, connect to a planning area and adjust the planning view according to your needs. Please also make your self familiar with the coding. The coding can be viewed by using the Visual Basic Editor.
